# Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services

Capstone project for Udacity data scientist nanodegree program

### Project Description

This project is the capstone project of Udacity data scientist nanodegree program. The goal of this project is to analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. Unsupervised learning techniques are used to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. A supervised model is built to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data is provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics and represents a real-life data science task.

There are four sections in this project:

Get to know the data
